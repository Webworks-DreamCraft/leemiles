            what it feels like to put alcohol in an open wound. It's a good idea
            to wash your tattoo as many times a day as you are exposed to
            bacteria. A conservative approach is to wash it once in the morning
            and once before bed. If you exercise, or are working outdoors,
            around food or animals, or your tattoo comes in contact with another
            person's skin, give it another wash
